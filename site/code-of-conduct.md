## Introduction

This code of conduct has been heavily influenced by (read copied from) the JSConf Code of Conduct. This may be updated from time to time to more specifically meet our needs.

All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any LeedsJS event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout any events and online communications related to LeedsJS.

## The Quick Version

LeedsJS is dedicated to providing harassment-free meet up experiences for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meet up participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meet up venue or online discussion, including talks given at the event. LeedsJS members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group at the discretion of the group's organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Organisers and helpers (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the group's organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the group.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of organisational team immediately.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meet ups, all LeedsJS related social events and on all online communication platforms related to LeedsJS.
