        "Research Fellow at Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA). I am a gradaute of School of Computing with my PhD on geological data visualization for learner geologists in the field. I have been developing software applications in various specialities such as Linked Data and Knowledge Bases, Android and iOS applications, various NoSQL/SQL DBMS, Tripple Stores. I try to be functional in my choice of programming languages but my first language was Java. I am new to data science but I know it leads to very interesting computation subjects (all practice at the moment with the theory at the autonomous driving seat).",
