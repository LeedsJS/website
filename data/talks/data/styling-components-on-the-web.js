    abstract: `Without styling, the world wide web would just be a load of boxes and plain text. That might have worked a couple of decades ago, but today we want more.

This is why CSS is great, as it makes it easy to create beautiful sites and apps. However, as time has passed and the complexity of app creation has increased, CSS has become harder to tame.

But all is not lost. In this talk we’ll explore some of the problems that are harder to tackle with plain CSS, and I’ll demonstrate how, when merged with JS, you can make things that little bit less complex and easier to maintain.`,
