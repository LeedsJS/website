    abstract: `Virtual reality means that creators can build an immersive experience for their users, whether that means transporting them to another time or place, or building an entirely new universe. Technology advances over the past few years means that these experiences are available to more people than ever, but usually these require expensive headsets and powerful PCs to run them.

But thanks to WebXR, we can use the web to build virtual reality and mixed reality experiences that can run in the browser! In this talk, weâ€™ll look at a few uses of WebXR, from displaying a 360 degree photo, to building our own world! By the end, I hope to have inspired you to give WebXR a try!`,
