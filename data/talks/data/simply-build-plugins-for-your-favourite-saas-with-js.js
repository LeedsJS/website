      "As the software has moved into the cloud we've lost direct control over the functionality we get from our tools. SaaS products such as Figma and Miro provide JavaScript SDKs that allow eager customers to extend the base functionality that these tools offer and to publish these plugins to help millions of other users too. In this session Colin Wren will talk about his journey through building his own app, creating a Miro plugin before pivoting to Figma and the lessons he's learned along the way.",
