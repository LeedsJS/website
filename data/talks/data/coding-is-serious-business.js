    abstract: `Coding is serious business. Except it isn't. Code gives us the power to unleash our creative potential in new and interesting ways, whether that’s making interactive art, creating live music and visualisations, building games or even adding joyful flourishes on a web app.

In this talk, I’ll show that our code doesn’t just have to be for building boring applications. Using real examples, I’ll talk about some ways that we can bring creativity into our coding projects, as well as ways for us to share our knowledge and why it’s important that we do. By the end, I hope to have inspired you to bring creativity into your projects and given you the enthusiasm to share your knowledge.`,
