      abstract: `“JAMstack” is an emerging term which some may like and others might not. It describes an approach to architecting and delivering sites as pre-rendered assets, and where necessary, enhancing them with JavaScript and services via APIs… an approach which some may like and others might not.

Personally I love this approach. And I want to explain why.

There has never been a better time for a fresh look at how we approach building and delivering web sites and applications. From the careful selection of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, to the use of emerging tools, services, and platforms.`,
