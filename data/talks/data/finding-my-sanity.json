  "abstract": "Following my previous talk \"What the JAMstack\" my talk will revise the basics of JAMstack i.e. what it is, why itâ€™s becoming so popular and also some of the potential drawbacks with using JAMstack. I will then follow up with a demonstration of a project using Gatsby along with a Headless CMS solution called Sanity. I will showcase how this fits into the JAMstack and why it is proving to be a success.",
