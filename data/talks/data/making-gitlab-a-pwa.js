We're not going to make a dummy application that's perfectly tailored for use with a PWA, then show you just how easy it is to turn it into one. We're not going to talk about how much faster, or how much more useful our website is now that it's a PWA. We're not even going to make anything particularly useful.

I'm going to show you how to use the concept of "the boring solution" to make small changes to a big application. Small changes that, over time, turn in to large ones. Specifically, my process of turning GitLab into a "PWA" in less than 100 lines of code.

This is a real story of GitLab's journey to a fully fledged PWA. One small step at a time.`,
