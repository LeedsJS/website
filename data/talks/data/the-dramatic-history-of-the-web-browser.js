        "abstract": `Microsoft announced at the end of 2018 that it was building a new browser based on Chromium. It will join an ever growing list of web browsers that are built on Google's open-source Chromium project. With Google Chrome's own share of the browser market continuing to grow does this mean Google have won the 'browser wars' and are comparisons with Microsoft's once dominant Internet Explorer fair? Now seems like a good time to re-examine the history of the web browser.

        Starting with its humble beginnings amongst the international physics community we'll trace the browserâ€™s journey through three decades of progress up to the present day. It's a story rife with competing corporations, lawsuits and surprise plot twists. Does history repeat itself and what could happen next to the web browser?`,
