    abstract: `This workshop is a unique way to learn about the accessibility issues people face when online or on their smart devices.  Using real life examples, we ask just one simple question…  

    “What is wrong in terms of accessibility?” 
    
    Whether you are new to accessibility, have some understanding or have experience with checking compliance, this is the session for you. Covering not only compliance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines but readability, usability and emotional accessibility too, you will be amazed how much can be packed into a short quiz! And how small things have a potentially big impact! After a short session finding the answers themselves, we will go through the answers together. 
    
    Spoiler! There are 10 images, 11 answers to find but many more than 11 things that could cause issues.
    
    As well as showing how the experience can be made better for everyone the quiz discusses issues for those with autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy, motor neurone disease, dyslexia and others.  It includes tips on readability using extensive research findings and the latest better practices available.  I’m constantly learning so the quiz is evolving as I refine the maximum learning opportunities for a single session.
    
    “I believe accessibility is fundamental to applications and greatly undervalued causing many problems for lots of users. I'm trying to spread the message that accessibility isn't about disability, it’s about inclusion! Remember, digital accessibility is a human right.”
