        "Visual analytics plays a key role in carrying out research. At Leeds Institute for Data Analytics I find myself writing JavaScript (React) directly than going through R or Python to visualize data-sets I work with. Data Visualization is an essential if not the end product of data analytics. I have been writing React code for three years. Prior to that it was Java, Python and Objective C mostly for Android and iOS. My current project is an eAtlas web application for the Alan Turing Institute, which is written in React to visualize geospatial data-sets. It is based on a framework I have been working on which relies on R and React.",
