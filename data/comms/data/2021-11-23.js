  Due to the current situation with COVID-19, I've decided to cancel our March event. I'd hate for anyone to get ill because of LeedsJS and it's better to be safe than sorry.
  
  As of right now, I don't know what the situation will be in April. I'm going to assume that it'll likely be a similar or worse situation, but I'll also be looking into how we can run LeedsJS as a fully remote event.
  
  Stay safe!
