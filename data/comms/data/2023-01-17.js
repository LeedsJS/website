    We are moving back to MeetUp to stay in touch that little bit easier. Unfortunately, will not be able to port over your current contact preferences automatically.
    
    So, please register at [https://www.meetup.com/leeds-js/](https://www.meetup.com/leeds-js/) to stay up to date. We will be updating the website to redirect to MeetUp in the next week or so.
    
    We also have our first event for 2023 planned for Weds Feb 8th; 'Getting into JS', please signup here: [https://www.meetup.com/leeds-js/events/290738052/](https://www.meetup.com/leeds-js/events/290738052/).
    
    If there is anything you would like to give a talk about or hear about then please get in touch!
    
    Many thanks,
    
    Rich`,
